# Roundcube CalDAVZap Plugin
A plugin for Roundcube to include CalDAVZap in to the main GUI. CalDAVZap is included in the plugin folder since version 1.02 of this plugin. The latest version i could found is 0.13.2rc1 from https://www.inf-it.com/mlmmj/davclients/2015-11/0000004.html. All credits goes to inf-it.com, the developers of CalDAVZap.

There are some minor tweaks i have made to: 
1. the **config.js** This is now preconfigured for a SabreDAV / Baikal server on the same host. If you need a other setup, you can look in to the config.js and change the config to your needs.
2. **interfce.js** I have found a small glitch displaying the wrong state of availabillity. I have fixed this and reported it back to inf-it.com. They have included this fix in his internal GIT.
3. **index.html** This file is the original version, i have made a copy called rc.html and tweaked the loginform a little bit. Mostly in that way that i hide the login form and some other small parts but keep the same functionallity.
